# Roadmap

Not so much a roadmap, as there are no dates or specific releases targeted for anything that appears below.
It's more a to-do list of issues to address and features that might make it into future releases.

1. Add rules management to the editor
   1. replace
   1. prepend/append
   1. insert, insert before, insert after
1. Clean up code!
   1. Make better use of BootstrapVue components
   1. Review all the Vue components and the code within (apologies to those with experience using Vue for the state of this code)
   1. Get rid of the EventBus and do things the proper way
1. Incorporate the Bootswatch theme switching that existed in the alpha version
1. Warn the user before overwriting existing files during file creation and import -- currently there are **no warnings** on filename collisions
